100Ly^3 cubes throughout the galaxy

I go to one of the 42 galactic regions and I create blanket search areas in the form of 100Ly^3 cubes. These are their stories.

Elysian Shore: 4x100Ly^3 cubes ~4000 systems
The Formidine Rift: 4x100Ly^3 cubes ~1000 systems
Outer-Orion Spur: 4x100Ly^3 cubes ~1000 systems
